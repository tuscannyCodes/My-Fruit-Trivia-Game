## Welcome to my Fruits Trivia Game App! This was a really fun project to build, and I genuinely had a great time working on it. I wanted to make the UI as simple and effective as possible. I spent 8 hours in total building this app. The main bulk of my time was spent building the function components and testing them for bugs and fixing problems (practiceButtonFunction, TriviaGameButtonsFunction). If I were to further build out this application, I would spend time working on removing the alert and prompt boxes, and replace them with custom components that complemented the style of the application. This application has a buit in score tracker, that keeps track of how many tries it takes for the user to get the correct answer. Given more time, I would also like to represent that score tracker as a visual element on the page. I would do this by using state to pull information from the TriviaGameButtonsFunction.It would be great to have a 'you win' animation at the end of each game as well. All in all, It was very important for me to seperate the components as much a possible in order to keep this project lean, and easy to read and navigate!
